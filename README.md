## HOW TO PLAY
It is a basic dice game, so you will **Roll the Dice** as much as you want and your dice values will be stored in your **Current Score**.
If you want to add your **Current Score** to your **Global Score** you just need to press the button **HOLD**. However, your turn will pass and the next player will play.
The player that gets to the **Final Score** value first wins the game!
Hey, hey...!
Hold on your horses! The game has some basic rules. First, if you roll the number **ONE** in one of your dices your **CURRENT SCORE** will be reset. Second, if you roll two **SIX** in both dices in a row your **GLOBAL AND CURRENT SCORE** will reset!!!!
Last but not least, good luck!
